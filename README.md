## Application information

The application have multiple profiles, DEV and PROD.

**DEV** profile uses an in-memory h2 database what can be accessed at: `/h2-console` where JDBC URL is `jdbc:h2:mem:cmsdb`
```
mvn clean install spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -Pdev
```

**PROD** profile uses local MySQL database which datasource URL is defined in the `application-prod.properties`.
```
mvn clean install spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=prod -Pprod
```
A mysql docker compose provided at: `\src\main\docker\mysql\docker-compose.yml`, you can start it up by changing to its directory and running `docker-compose up`.

*(If your host machine can not access the docker database on localhost, get the specific IP with `docker-machine ip default`)*

For testing purposes, the application can populate data on startup by setting the property `create.default.application.data=true` in `application.properties`.

## Authentication

The application is using **OAuth 2.0** authentication mechanism. To use any API functionality, you need to request access token by granting correct credentials:

For example requesting access token with 'admin':
```
POST http://localhost:8080/oauth/token

Body has x-www-form-urlencoded values:

grant_type=password
username=admin
password=admin

Header has basic auth of the client credentials and content type:

Authorization=Basic Y2xpZW50OnMzY3IzdHA0c3M=
Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

After receiving the token, it is required in the following requests as a header.
```
http://localhost:8080/api/customers/1

With Header:

Authorization=Bearer 95a662ba-a359-4c48-b3cf-d7ef60b0165e
``` 

## Docker setup

The application supports running on docker by having its own docker image `crm-backend` based on `java:8` image.

The included Maven wrapper can be used to build it locally from the `project directory` the following way on a compiled project:

```
./mvnw docker:build
```

It should create the following files in the target folder:
```
\docker\crm-rest-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
\docker\dockerfile
```

Then the application can be started, by default it needs to expose port 8080.

The command starts the application and maps container port 8080 (second) to port 8080 of the host machine (first).
```
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 crm-backend
```

After successfully started, it can be accessed the following way:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/customers
```
*If `localhost` can not be reached from host machine, you need to look up the Host IP of the container:*
```
docker-machine env

-> 

export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.100:2376"
```

And use Host IP address to access the application:
```
GET http://192.168.99.100:8080/api/customers
```
